# Signup Form Validation

This project is a web-based student signup form with real-time input validation. Users can enter their email, country code, zip code, and set a password, and the system provides instant feedback on the validity of the inputs.

## How It Works

-   The webpage is designed to be responsive and visually appealing, using HTML and CSS.
-   Real-time validation is achieved through JavaScript:
    -   Email validation ensures a valid email format.
    -   Country code validation checks if it follows the expected format (e.g., "US").
    -   Zip code validation verifies the input is in the correct format (e.g., "12345").
    -   Password and password confirmation are compared to ensure they match.
-   Error messages are displayed below the input fields to guide the user.
